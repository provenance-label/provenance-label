# Provenance Label

**A nutrition label for AI-assisted content**

An open standard for transparent disclosure of AI collaboration in creative work.

## What is this?

The Provenance Label is a simple, standardized way to show how human and AI worked together on content. Like nutrition labels for food, it provides transparency without judgment.

## The Standard (v1.0)
```
PROVENANCE LABEL v1.0
Created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC (optional)
Edited: Yes/No

Human contribution: [0-100%]
AI contribution: [0-100%]
AI models used: [model names]

Process notes: [1-2 sentence description]

Adjustments: [if Edited=Yes, explain changes]
```

## How to Use

1. **Start your AI collaboration** by saying: "Let's use Provenance Label standards."
2. **Generate the label** when done: "Generate the Provenance Label"
3. **Add it to your work** (bottom of posts, README, artist statements, etc.)

Or use the [Label Generator](https://provenancelabel.com) on the website.

## Why This Exists

- AI collaboration is here to stay
- Transparency builds trust
- Readers/users deserve to know
- Creators need a simple way to disclose

**Not anti-AI. Pro-honesty.**
